# Dataset Distillation

This part is adapted from one classical [Dataset Distillation](https://ssnl.github.io/dataset_distillation) implementation, we use this code to show how could pravega be helpful in AI and how could AI benefit the pravega. Because for the pravega part, we basically use the reader and writer to manage the data, it is not included in this repo. Details could be found in demo video and our slides.

And for incremental learning shown in the demo, DDIL.tar.gz contains all the data and codes you need to reproduce our result.
